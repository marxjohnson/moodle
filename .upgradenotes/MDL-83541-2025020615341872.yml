        Duplication or multiple restores or questions has been modified to avoid
        errors where a question with the same stamp already exists in the target
        category.


        To achieve this all data for the question is hashed, excluding any ID
        fields.


        If a qtype plugin calls any `$this->add_question_*()` methods its
        `restore_qtype_*_plugin::define_question_plugin_structure()` method, the
        ID fields used in these records will be excluded automatically.


        If a qtype plugin defines its own tables with ID fields, it must define
        `restore_qtype_*_plugin::define_excluded_fields()` to return an array of
        those field names. This should be all that is required for the majority
        of plugins. See `qtype_truefalse` for an example.


        If the data structure for a qtype returned by calling
        `get_question_options()` contains data other than ID fields that are not
        contained in the backup structure or vice-versa, it will need to
        override `restore_qtype_*_plugin::reduce_question_data()` to remove the
        inconsistent data. See `qtype_multianswer` as an example.
