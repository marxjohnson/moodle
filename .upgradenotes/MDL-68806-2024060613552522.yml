    - message: >
        External functions used by the app to get quiz attempts,
        mod_quiz_get_user_attempts and mod_quiz_review_attempt, have been
        modified to return SUBMITTED attempts as FINISHED, and NOT_STARTED
        attempts as IN_PROGRESS, to retain backwards-compatibility with the app.
        These functions have been deprecated in favour of
        mod_quiz_get_user_quiz_attempts and mod_quiz_review_quiz_attempt, which
        will return attempts in their true states.
      type: deprecated
