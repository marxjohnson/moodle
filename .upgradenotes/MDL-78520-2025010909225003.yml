        The new data mapper API has been added to allow plugins that
        store additional question data to import and export that data
        via the Moodle XML format.

        Documentation can be found in the devdocs at
        API guides > Plugin types > Question bank plugins > Data mapper API,
        and an example can be found in qbank_customfields.
